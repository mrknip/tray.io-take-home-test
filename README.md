# Tray.io take home test

A sample sign-up form to demo some JS. Bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Dear reviewers - getting started

Thanks for taking a look! To get started, you will need:

- node (>=v12.x.x)
- npm (>=v5.x.x) - if running the production build locally, as the deploy script piggybacks off npx
- yarn

#### Method 1: serve production build locally

This will build the production build, then run a simple static server so you can have a look around

- Clone the repo
- `yarn install`
- `yarn deploy`
- navigate to `localhost:5000`

#### Method 2: just run the dev build

If you wanted to tinker with the code as part of your review, then:

- Clone the repo
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`
- navigate to `localhost:3000`

#### Method 3: lazy option

It's up on netlify in case of environment issues, or if you're feeling lazy: https://djohnson-trayio-test.netlify.app/[https://djohnson-trayio-test.netlify.app/]

## To run tests

- `yarn test`
